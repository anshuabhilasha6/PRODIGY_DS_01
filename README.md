TASK 01: CREATE A BAR CHART OR HISTOGRAM TO VISUALIZE THE DISTRIBUTION OF A CATEGORIAL OR CONTINUOUS VARIABLE , SUCH AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF AGES OR GENDERS IN A POPULATION.
In this task , I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis ( EDA) on a dataset provided.

The dataset used for this task is worldpopulationdata which contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022.

Tools ‚öíÔ∏è and libraries üìö used are:-

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ( EDA)

During the EDA process , I performed the following process:
1. Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates and Handled them accordingly.
2. Visualization: Created a bar plot and Stacked bar plot.

In conclusion,this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset.
